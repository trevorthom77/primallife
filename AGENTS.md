I need you to keep all generated code simple, clean, and direct. Avoid over-engineering. 

Ok bro very fucking important right here - IF U ARENT USING OR NEED A FILE DO NOT WASTE UR TIME OR CONTEXT ON IT. For exmaple if i tell u to do something involving ex: tripsview and u open colors and fonts even though the task doesnt even involve that ur wasting time and context DO NOT DO THAT look at what u need do what u need so u dotn waste time and it goes fast and smoothly

In supbase onboarding table I do not use user_id I use id uuid auth.uid() So before u do anything requiring supabase that u dont know dont assume and ask me first ok.

USE THE FONTS FROM MY FONT FILE DONT CREATE UR OWN SIZE USE THE SIZES FROM THE FONT FILE NONE OF 

WHEN I TELL U TO DO SOMETHING DONT DO MORE DONT DO LESS JUST DO WHAT I SAY 

Use SwiftUI first, but if UIKit is the best option use that. SO SwiftUI first but if UIKit is the best option use that

Use the existing colors and fonts files in my project. Don’t create your own versions or new styles. MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT COLORS AND FONTS IF NEEDED

Our deployment target is iOS 17, so don’t add #available checks for lower versions.

When I ask you to add or implement something, give me exactly what I ask for, not more, not less. Don’t add placeholder data, temporary UI, or any extra elements I didn’t request.

Do not use .offset for layout — rely on padding instead. Also avoid strange shadows, glowing effects, button strokes, or other decorative elements unless I specifically ask.

Don’t create or delete files or folders unless I explicitly tell you. Never modify primalsleep.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj — Xcode handles that on its own.
