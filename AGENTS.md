I need you to keep all generated code simple, clean, and direct. Avoid over-engineering. 

In supbase onboarding table I do not use user_id I use id uuid auth.uid() So before u do anything requiring supabase that u dont know dont assume and ask me first ok.

USE THE FONTS FROM MY FONT FILE DONT CREATE UR OWN SIZE USE THE SIZES FROM THE FONT FILE NONE OF 

WHEN I TELL U TO DO SOMETHING DONT DO MORE DONT DO LESS JUST DO WHAT I SAY 

Use SwiftUI only, never UIKit.

Use the existing colors and fonts files in my project. Don’t create your own versions or new styles. MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT COLORS AND FONTS

Our deployment target is iOS 17, so don’t add #available checks for lower versions.

When I ask you to add or implement something, give me exactly what I ask for — not more, not less. Don’t add placeholder data, temporary UI, or any extra elements I didn’t request.

Avoid unnecessary loading states. That means no random ProgressView spinners, and no redundant error messages. One or two error states per app is enough.

Do not use .offset for layout — rely on padding instead. Also avoid strange shadows, glowing effects, button strokes, or other decorative elements unless I specifically ask.

Don’t create or delete files or folders unless I explicitly tell you. Never modify primalsleep.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj — Xcode handles that on its own.
